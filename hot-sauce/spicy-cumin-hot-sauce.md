# Spicy Cumin Sauce

by Jonathan Deutsch, October 2021


### Overview

Chinese Spicy Lamb Skewers have a wonderful cumin rub that go on them. I thought this could be made into a hot sauce to pair with meats.

This recipe is not very spicy; I recommend changing the chilis for more kick.  (I would not use habanero, however).


### Ingredients

##### Heat

- 45g Red Jalape√±o Chili Peppers (deseeded)
- 1/4 tsp Shichimi Togarashi
- 22g Chili Water (from rehydrating chilis from other recipe)

- 100g Red Bell Pepper
- 35g onion
- 11g garlic

##### Vinegars

- 110g Rice Vinegar
- 20g Distilled White Vinegar
- 18g Apple Cider Vinegar

##### Other liquids
